# Ridiculously Responsive Social Sharing Buttons
<p>Love them or hate them social sharing buttons appear to be with us for a while. It seemed like <a href="http://www.kurtnoble.com">we</a> were constantly making custom buttons for every single project, so we decided to create a super flexible system that would work in any container.</p>

<p>RRSSB is built with <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">SASS</a>, so you can easily customize it by tweaking a few variables. SVGs allow for tiny file size and retina support. Add or remove icons as you see fit &mdash; the rest will fill in automagically in the container.</p>
