# Ridiculously Responsive Social Sharing Buttons

Love them or hate them social sharing buttons appear to be with us for a while. It seemed like [we](http://www.kurtnoble.com) were constantly making custom buttons for every single project, so we decided to create a super flexible system that would work in any container.

RRSSB is built with [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/), so you can easily customize it by tweaking a few variables. SVGs allow for tiny file size and retina support. Add or remove icons as you see fit &mdash; the rest will fill in automagically in the container.

Adding a class of `popup` to the anchor tag for each share button will make the share dialog open in a popup, rather than a new window.
